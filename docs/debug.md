## Debug

```
helm install --dry-run --debug ./m8s > /tmp/manifest
```


## Makefile

#### install minikube

minikube, kubctl, and helm are updated often, it can't hurt to run this accordingly

```
make reqs
```


#### helm install .

this is the default for this makefile

```
make
```

#### make debug

you can also save a debug copy of what manifest file will be generated
using:

```
make debug
```

This will produce output pointing you to the saved manifest file in your
temp directory:

```
make debug
helm install --dry-run --debug . > /tmp/tmp.zZGCOwCCoqDOCKERTMP/manifest
ls -lh /tmp/tmp.zZGCOwCCoqDOCKERTMP/manifest
-rw-r--r-- 1 thoth thoth 5.0K Nov 22 15:44
/tmp/tmp.zZGCOwCCoqDOCKERTMP/manifest
```


#### Perftest

```
make timeme
```

How long to spin up the cluster?
Travis-CI builds it in just over two minutes:

This now waits on all three mongo containers to spin up and the
m8s container to be 'Running'.
